# pyAC - Python Arithmetic Codec

Basic prototype of an Arithmetic Coder and Decoder. Designed to:

- Help understand the underlying finite-precision arithmetic
- Practice and analyze static and adaptive probability models

Have a lot of fun!

-- Miguel Hern√°ndez-Cabronero https://deic.uab.cat/~mhernandez

## Dependencies

`pip install bitarray`

## Contents

* pyac.py: main library module. Includes the ArithmeticEncoder, ArithmeticDecoder and ProbabilityTable classes. 
* ac8bit_uniform.py: example 8-bit codec implementation using a static, uniform probability model.
    To be used as a template (don't expect any compression!)
